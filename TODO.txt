Add title and brief description changable in the config file.

Allow user to add their own hand-coded Plotly plots- where do they do the config, how is it included in the HTML?

Save a user's preferences for graph configuration. Store the last form as a cookie and use it as the default? Store the form on the server side with a user-provided name and allow a user to select the form they want from a dropdown? This would work also as a way of sharing a graph config.

Shareable graph configs- either a URL-encoded version for a GET that could be shared, or store a config server side that can be selected (as described above)

# save state of the website.

Low:
Simplify the config file
Implement Administrator class
 - walk through

limitations/decisions:
Cannot switch between x and y on the fly.
Plots on the same page can use different tables
Graph on use a single data set
Need to be connected to the internet
Assuming csv in local handler
gets most recent data set
Cannot select along nan


Replicating Existing Escalation Functionality:
Add data download option (both most recent data and older versions of the data?), with a url endpoint (on its own blueprint)
Data upload options: 1) direct upload via a web interface 2) API upload which will interact with versioned data, etc. These methods probably use the same controller/model functionality, and the direct upload is just a web interface to the functionality.

Add another db table with a relationship to an existing db table, and build a graph that pulls from 2 tables?



# Document workflow for onboarding:
# Run csv to schema on file, build the sqlalchemy schema from the db write (after manual validation), Repeat for more files, specify which graphs are built from which files
# store schema from this stage to use to validate future data uploads, or use the model definition? Question to address: How hard should it be to upload a new file format? Does the app just ignore columns that aren't in the schema?
