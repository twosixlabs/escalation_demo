Check of plotly python fig.
Implement database

Low:
Simplify the config file
Implement Administrator class

limitations/decisions:
Cannot switch between x and y on the fly.
Plots on the same page can use different tables
Graph on use a single data set
Need to be connected to the internet
Assuming csv in local handler
gets most recent data set
Cannot select along nan


Replicating Existing Escalation Functionality:
Add data download option (both most recent data and older versions of the data?), with a url endpoint (on its own blueprint)
Data upload options: 1) direct upload via a web interface 2) API upload which will interact with versioned data, etc. These methods probably use the same controller/model functionality, and the direct upload is just a web interface to the functionality.
