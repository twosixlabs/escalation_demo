# graphics functionality
Allow user to add their own hand-coded Plotly plots- where do they do the config, how is it included in the HTML?
 Save state of the website / user's preferences for graph configuration. Store the last form as a cookie and use it as the default? Store the form on the server side with a user-provided name and allow a user to select the form they want from a dropdown? This would work also as a way of sharing a graph config.
Shareable graph configs- either a URL-encoded version for a GET that could be shared, or store a config server side that can be selected (as described above)
plot multiple scatters etc different colors using filter
# App configuration
Document workflow for onboarding:
Run csv to schema on file, build the sqlalchemy schema from the db write (after manual validation), Repeat for more files, specify which graphs are built from which files
store schema from this stage to use to validate future data uploads, or use the model definition? Question to address: How hard should it be to upload a new file format? Does the app just ignore columns that aren't in the schema?
# Data management
Which version of the data do we display? Management page to select "Active data files" or "active sql row keys" which get loaded. May combine multiple files/keys into single graph
Add data download option (both most recent data and older versions of the data?), with a url endpoint (on its own blueprint)
Data upload options: 1) direct upload via a web interface 2) API upload which will interact with versioned data, etc. These methods probably use the same controller/model functionality, and the direct upload is just a web interface to the functionality.
Add another db table with a relationship to an existing db table, and build a graph that pulls from 2 tables?
USER STORIES
Real time data from fermenter (temp, pH) with updates on dashboard, including
Low:
Simplify the config file
Implement Administrator class
 - walk through
limitations/decisions:
Graph can only use a single data set, defined by the handler
Assuming csv in local handler
Local handler currently gets most recent data set
Cannot select along nan values in the db or file

Enforce no spaces or weird characters in column names
